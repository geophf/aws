## Microservices use, a start-up example

* Did you know – Forbes, BBC, Virginia Pilot, … journals and publications – how do they highlight ‘interesting terms’ in each article? Interns and Editors, by hand.
* OUR START-UP, TO THE RESCUE!
* Forbes: 3 million hits per month, Virginia Pilot, 20 hits per minute
* Our system: ETL of publication’s entire corpus updated every hour, NER, Clustering … all with microservices.
